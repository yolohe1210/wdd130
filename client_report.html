    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>For my site plan, I first selected the theme of “Conan Town” and chose a matching color palette. I organized the main content into two categories—exclusive experiences and practical tips—so the information would be clear and easy to follow. I included photos from my own album as well as images found online to better illustrate my travel experience. I communicated with my developer through Teams and did not encounter any major communication issues. The final site met my basic expectations, and in future projects I would communicate more frequently with the developer to encourage more detailed design and development.</p>
    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>After receiving the site plan from the client, I shared it with the team in our Teams group chat and assigned each junior developer one child page to complete, since the pages followed the same structure and requirements. Communication with the client was also done through Teams, and there were no major problems during the process. When the initial version of the site was published on GitHub, I immediately shared the link with the client and continued to update the site through pull and merge actions as the team sent in their changes. One junior developer initially had trouble accessing GitHub, but resending the invitation quickly resolved the issue. Overall, managing the site on GitHub was an efficient experience, allowing us to collaborate smoothly and view updates in real time.</p>
    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>As a junior developer on several teams, I communicated with my team leads through Teams, and they provided clear expectations by sharing the site plans in our group chats. This made it easy to understand my responsibilities for each project. I was able to contribute effectively by following an existing child page design in one project to maintain consistency and by editing an HTML file and adding new CSS in another project to complete the assigned page. I did not experience any significant difficulties using GitHub, and I successfully added my changes to the repositories. Overall, the collaboration process was smooth and productive.</p>
    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part of this multi-team project was time management, especially because one team did not receive the site plan until the week of the deadline, which required us to complete the entire project quickly. Even so, we were able to finish everything by staying focused and working efficiently. I especially enjoyed the remote collaboration aspect of this project, as it provided flexibility and gave me experience with real teamwork in a development environment. If I were to do the project again, I would start earlier and maintain more frequent communication to avoid last-minute time pressure. Overall, this experience strengthened my confidence in working on real-world projects because it gave me hands-on practice in team coordination, GitHub version control, and completing tasks based on a client's requirements.</p>
